# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Contributions are welcome, but to avoid unnecessary effort on both sides:

- **Open an Issue First**: Before submitting a pull request, please open an issue to describe the problem or
  feature you'd like to address. This applies to all types of contributions, including bug fixes.
- **Await Approval to work on an issue**: I prefer to give the green light on issues before they are worked on. This
  helps ensure your efforts align with the project's scope.

Thank you for your understanding and for helping make this project better!
